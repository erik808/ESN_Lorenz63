# ESN_Lorenz63

This is my attempt to repeat the paper <em> Using machine learning to replicate chaotic attractors and calculate Lyapunov exponents from data</em>, Pathak et. al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5010300.

The echo state network (ESN) is as minimal as I could get it. This means its architecture is pretty limited but it may serve some educational purposes.
